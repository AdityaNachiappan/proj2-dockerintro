# Basic commands

* Command to get information about docker setup on your machine

  ~~~~
  docker info
  ~~~~

* List of docker containers running can be found using

  ~~~~
  docker ps -a
  ~~~~

* Remove containers using

  ~~~~
  sudo docker rm <Container Name>
  ~~~~

* To run docker container use

  ~~~~
  docker run -h CONTAINER1 -i -t debian /bin/bash
  docker run -h CONTAINER1 -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
  ~~~~

  Here, -h is used to specify a container name, -t to start with tty, and -i means interactive. Note: second times will be quick because of caching.

* Docker with networking

  ~~~~
  docker run -h CONTAINER2 -i -t --net="bridge" debian /bin/bash
  ~~~~

* When the containers are not running and when you're done, kill them using

  ~~~~
  docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq`
  ~~~~

* Rename using

  ~~~~
  docker rename name_v0 name_v1
  ~~~~

# Creating images

* Create a Dockerfile. The name is case sensitive and it has to be "Dockerfile"

  ~~~~
  vim Dockerfile
  ~~~~

* FROM command specifies the base image you are going to use build your dockerfile and your new image. It's can an existing image, like ubuntu, alpine, debian, etc.

  ~~~~
   FROM ubuntu
  ~~~~

* CMD command specifies all the commands you need to run

  ~~~~
   CMD echo hello world
  ~~~~

* Build the image with folder name ("." in this case)

  ~~~~
   docker build .
  ~~~~

* Output

  ~~~~

6) Run the image using the image ID ("e2e741ea5f6f" in this case) and a test
name of your choice

  ~~~~
  docker run --name <test name> e2e741ea5f6f
  ~~~~

7) List images using
